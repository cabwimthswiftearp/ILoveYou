       <div> Hi babe! So, erm the next part of this page was written a few days before yk those 24 hours happened, and I'm writing this just a 
       few mins after we got back together...but the original message before all that happened is here...so if you're reading this it means we 
       actually did get back together <3 and Rao knows how relieved I am. I love you <3 </div>


       <h1>Hey Gorgeous <3 </h1>
       <h1>Happy 2 Months to us baby <3 </h1>
       
        <div>
            January has been a busy month, but you never fail to make me feel just as happy and as content as I was when we first started talking more 
            leading up to right now. I love you so so much, cait , and I hope you always remember that. You've given my life and my future so much 
            clarity, and I can't wait for the day we both take on life's adventures side by side. Thank you for making me the happiest and the luckiest 
            person to ever exist all because you let me in and allowed me to be a part of your life. I can't wait to meet you irl ü•∫.

       <div>
            And every day you give me more reasons to fall in love with you. Knowing you more and more each day is one of the best things 
            that can happen in my life, and I don't know what I did to have been so lucky and to have you. Baby, believe me when I say that I 
            think you are those things I said above. You really are perfect to me ü•∫ I can't believe that one day I'll be able to call you my wife 
            and the mother of our children. Our kids would be so so lucky to have you and be taken care of by someone as sweet, gentle, and loving as 
            you. I know I wouldn't have it any other way.
       </div>
       
       <div>
           
            I'm so in love with you, Cait ü•∫ I know we've only been dating for 2 months, and we've only known each other for 261 days, but I can 
            say that this is the surest I have been in my entire life. I know this letter is so similar to the one I sent before, but this is my 
            way of saying that I still feel as sure as I was 31 days ago, and I'm even more sure now that I want my future to be with you and you 
            only. I love you so so much, Cait <3
       </div>

       <p class ="last">
            No matter what, I'll fight for what we have <3
        
            Happy 2 months üòò
       </p>
       
       
       <div class = "e">
        ....and after February 1, I have come to the surest conclusion that I seriously never want to lose you or lose what we have. That shit 
        hurt like hell. I'm so so soo happy we made up. I don't know how I would've survived up til today if we had not.
